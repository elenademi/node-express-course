"Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application."
We used it in this assignment to parse JSON. It can also be used for authentication, logging, 
reading the request and response objects, handling errors. It is like a layer in between other layers in an application.

"What does CRUD stand for?"
Create, read, update, delete - to do operations with a database.

"You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?"
You have to use "require("dotenv") to use the installed package. You have to use an asynchronous function in app.js
 that will use try/catch statements like this: "await connectDB(process.env.MONGO_URI)"

"How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?"
You add them to the .gitignore file.
